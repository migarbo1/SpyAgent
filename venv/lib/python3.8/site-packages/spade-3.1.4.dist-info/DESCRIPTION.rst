Smart Python Agent Development Environment

A multi-agent systems platform written in Python and based on instant messaging (XMPP).

Develop agents that can chat both with other agents and humans.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: http://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/


Features
--------

* Multi-agent platform based on XMPP_
* Presence notification allows the system to know the current state of the agents in real-time
* Python >=3.6
* Asyncio-based
* Agent model based on behaviours
* Supports FIPA metadata using XMPP Data Forms (XEP-0004_: Data Forms)
* Web-based interface
* Use any XMPP server
